description: Foreign Language? Translate it!
---

# translater

{% hint style="info" %}
This is more of a command rather than a module. We may add automatic translation in the future.
{% endhint %}

Example usage: `d!translate en es Hello, world!`

In the command above en represents the present language while es represents the output. Hello, world! is the language to translate.

The bot SHOULD detect input language automatically meaning you should only be required to specify the output.
