# Common Issues and Fixes

## Revolt Permissions

I have found out that the BEST way for me was to uncheck `send messages`for the default role in the server settings. This means you have to apply it per channel however this is the only work-around I have found for this weird permission system.



Announcements should respond if you have given it a role with send messages and specified that role in the specific channel. If you turn off default permission to send messages in that channel I have found that it doesn't work. (This may just be a me problem, but I want to add this in-case others are getting stuck)
